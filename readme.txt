Rigs of Rods - v0.4.0.7 retro edition
=====================================

INTRO
-----

This branch is based on v0.4.0.7 source code from year 2013
and updated to use recent components (OGRE 1.11.6, MyGUI 3.4.0).

The purpose is to have a working instance of the original
truck parser/spawner logic, for diagnosing defects
in the current upstream parser.

EXTRAS
------

RoR.cfg setting "diag_actor_dump" (bool) writes 2 files to /logs:
 1. truckname_dump_raw.txt ~ original data from truck file
 2. truckname_dump_recalc.txt ~ after recalc. masses, pressurizing tires and other adjustments
The output is equivalent to the same setting in upstream,
it's intended for comparsion using diff tool.
 
BUILDING
--------

Only tested on Windows10 + MSVC2019, needs a lot of manual adjustments.

1. run cmake; build outside the source tree

2. set ROR_DEPENDENCIES dir; you'll need to manually assemble the includes/libs to the expected layout:
    includes/x64:
        AngelScript\
        moFileReader\
        MyGUI\
        OGRE\
        OIS\
        OpenAL\
        PagedGeometry\
    libs/x64:
        moFileReader\
        MyGUI\ ~ MyGUIEngine.lib + MyGUI.OgrePlatform.lib (from conan), freetype.lib (from latest conan OGREDeps)
        OGRE\
        OIS\
        OpenAL\
        PagedGeometry\
        pthread\ ~ pthreadVC3.lib (from vcpkg)
    
   
3. generate visual studio project

4. select build config: RelWithDebInfo
